# Command Design Pattern
The Command pattern encapsulates actions as objects. Command objects allow for loosely coupled systems by separating the objects that issue a request from the objects that actually process the request. These requests are called events and the code that processes the requests are called event handlers.

The Command pattern allows you to maintain a stack of commands 
that you apply to a state and you cand do and undo them and
manage the undo stack in an application.
